# Full-stack Capstone Project: StudyHub

StudyHub is a MERN-stack web app that helps my classmates and me organize our post-course review sessions. Each user can create “Courses” (for example, “Backend Review” or “React Deep Dive”), and within each course they create “Study Tasks” like assignments, readings, practice problems, or review sessions. Users can track statuses (To Do, In Progress, Done) and use the tool during our twice-weekly study meetings to stay on the same page.
